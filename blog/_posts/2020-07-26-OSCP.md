title:  "Road to the OSCP!"
---

I remember always being fascinated about how hackers managed to get inside of networks and release sensitive information to the public. I remember the massive DoS attack that hit Sony's servers back in the holidays of 2014 and ruined christmas for many people who had just gotten a playstation 4. Ever since then, when i searched about how to do hacking professionally one certification always ranked at the top of my google searches. 

The OSCP

I read the description of what the course was, but the criteria to obtain the certification is what always made me think, wow, this thing must be the real deal. For those of you who don't know. To become an Offensive Security Certified Professional you must break into a total of 5 machines on their network within the span of 24 hours. "That seems cool" i thought to myself, but never really invisioned myself actually putting in the time to acquire the skills to obtain the cert.

Fast Forward to now, as the world deals with COVID-19, i thought to myself that i might as well put social distancing to good use and embrace the hacker stereotype. I shut myself away for three months in my apartment and began honing my skills for the exam. Below was exactly what i did to pass in the first go, hopefully anyone who is reading this can find some value out of my experience.


# April 14th - May 2nd



## # The Beginning

I registered for Offsec's course April 14th. There is a two week period of them processing your information before you can start in the lab / recieve your PDF material for the course. During this time I purchased a monthly subscription to HackTheBox and began watching a youtuber named ippsec walk through some of the challenges on this site. I thought this was highly valuable as it was as close to shadowing a professional pentester as i was ever going to get. Of course he's doing Capture The Flag challenges so a lot of the situations are unrealistic, however following him and attempting to conquer some of the challenges on HackTheBox yourself, will get you very acquainted with Kali Linux. It is also beneficial to see the mindset of a professional. As ippsec does his enumeration, it is invaluable to notice, especially as a beginner, the methodology.

New Machine?
**NMAP scan the ports.**

Port 80 is open?
**Use a web browser to navigate to the site.**

Nothing Interesting on the site?
**Check the html source code with your web browser?**

Still Nothing?
**Break out your favorite directory brute forcing tool and see if you can find some hidden directories.**

Found an application installed in the web directory?
**Time to research if it has any vulnerabilities.**

The OSCP is all about perfecting your instincts on the above process and Ippsec does a great job of breaking it down while making it look easy.

# May 2nd - Jun 18th
### # Into The Labs

The next month and a half I worked my way about 3/4 through the PDF provided by offsec. I was trying to be a diligent student and do all the exercises as I progressed through the material, but i was itching to dive into the labs. If you spent any time at all watching a good amount of ippsec videos and trying to do some HTB challenges then a good portion of the OSCP PDF will be more like review and occasionally deeper explanation of some topics than fresh new material.

At around two weeks in and at about chapter 18, I gave up on the PDF and began trying to attack Offsec's network.I would like to say at this point that I was not a huge fan of their lab environment. As a complete beginner, i felt entirely lost and there is a strange culture within the Offsec forums which is referred to as the "Try Harder" culture. Basically if what you are doing is not working, you are probably missing something and you should try harder to find what you need. I don't think it's stated anywhere specifically but you get a real sense that if you defer to the forums for advice, you've essentially admitted defeat on a particular machine.

My problem with this is, as a complete beginner, you don't know what you don't know and you could spend hours banging your head against something that you would never get in a million years because it just simply was not taught to you. So my personal advice is for the PWK labs, try very very hard by yourself, but if you are sitting there at hour three and still staring at the home page of a machine, defer to forums and get some tips and DO NOT FEEL ASHAMED. 

So at around June 18th i had rooted about 12 machines in the public network and really had no desire to penetrate deeper in Offsec's lab. I had also attempted some machines on Vulnhub but your mileage may vary with the quality of targets they provide on there. I was done in the lab however I knew I was far from ready to attempt the exam.

# Jun 18th - Jul 11th
### # Virtual Hacking Labs

By this point I want to say I probably had a total of 200 hours sunk into practicing my penetration skills. They were hard and at times I really considered if I had the chops for this. One thing was for sure though, I still needed more practice. After searching around the net, I came upon VHL, Virtuall Hacking Labs, and i think this was by far the most valuable prep tool I had for the exam. VHL is a little pricey at 100 USD for a month of lab time, but their targets are very similar to OSCP targets and they have this great added bonus of non spoiler hints for when you get stuck on their beginner/advanced machines. 

There is a lot of talk about how people who desire to take the OSCP should start with VHL then move to the OSCP lab however i think it should be the opposite. I think you should go into the OSCP lab a newbie, experience the misery / joy of rooting around 10 - 15 boxes in PWK, then take that experience to VHL. I think that at this point you should be able to take on most if not all of the machines in the VHL lab with minimal/no hints and it is at this point where you can guage if you are ready for the exam or not. For two weeks I worked through a couple of advanced/beginner machines in VHL. I didn't really need any assistance on any of them. Then I tried one of thier advanced+ machines. These machines have no hints, and you are completely left to your methodology to compromise them. I attempted one of these advanced+ machines and to my surprise I did not find it extremely difficult. Interesting? Yes. Challenging? Yes. Required skills that i had not acquired previously? No. When fresh boxes you try to exploit start fitting this criteria, you can bet that you are on the right track. It was also at this point I decided to start mocking the OSCP exam on the weekend.

It goes like this.

You select 5 machines from the VHL lab

1 Beginner machine - 10 pts

1x Advanced Machinese - 20 pts

1x Advanced Machinese - 20 pts

1x Advanced+ Machinese - 25 pts

Buffer Overflow Exercise - 25 pts

(If you still have time in the PWK labs now is the time to attempt to compromise the practice BoF vulnapps provided by offsec. VHL does not provide BOF machines so you will have to defer to the internet and install vulnerable apps, I recommend SLMAIL.)

If you are curious about which machines I did here they are (Vulnapp3 is a BoF exercise provided by Offsec):

Attempt 1

If you can get a passing score within 24 hours without using hints, use that as a good indication that you have a fighting chance on the exam. Also this link provides good insight into the OSCP like VHL machines:

### # Surprise! Fight day got moved up!

I scored 75 points on my practice attempt 1 above and 65 points on attempt 2. After realising what went wrong on both attempts and what I could do better I realised that at this point i had learned everything that I needed to learn for the exam. And that whether I passed or failed would ultimately come down to how well i execute the methodology I'd been cultivating for the past two months. I originally had my exam scheduled for August 1st, but I just felt ready, so on Jul 14th I decided to move my exam to the upcoming saturday, Jul 18th. For the next three days i did not hack.... okay i did one vulnhub machine the night before the exam, but I spent the majority of the time putting the finishing touches on my lab report. When saturday came around, i woke up at 6:45 am, got a good workout in, and started my exam at 8:00am. Within 14 hours i managed to complete the BOF, root two machiens and establish a foothold on the other two, which by my assumed calculations was enough to pass. At this point i began writing the rough draft of my report and ensuring i got the appropriate screenshots to secure my points. I don't know who needs to hear this but THE REPORT IS JUST AS IMPORTANT IF NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ACTUAL EXAM.

I'm so serious about the above, you could pwn all 5 machines out of the galaxy and still fail if your report is not good. Every time you get user / root/ administrator on a machine STOP, ipconfig/ifconfig then cat the user.txt or proof.txt and immediately take that screenshot. If you do not provide these screenshots on the exam YOU WILL NOT GET THE POINTS.

I used this resource to format my report, its done in a way that makes it difficult to forget the critical screenshots: https://github.com/whoisflynn/OSCP-Exam-Report-Template

All in all if you crack enough machines, provide the critical screenshots outlined by offsec, and explain very well how you arrived to compromise each machine you should pass.

### # Roll Credits

No one every tells you that waiting for the results of the exam is the most stressful part of the exam. Did write the report correctly? Did i explain enough? Damn I forgot an NMAP scan on this part! I made a typo! If you are like me, you will be reading your report over and over again in a very counter productive cycle to see why they might fail you on the report.Relax, if you followed their directions(If there were ever a time to read the directions, this exam is the time) and provided the appropriate screenshots (ipconfig and proof.txt) and explained reasonably well how you arrived at exploiting the machines(use a lot of screenshots) you should recieve your pass email within 10 business days.

Overall I'm happy this is over with. I feel as though i have a solid base of knowledge to go deeper into more advanced topics of penetration testing... I'm looking at you Active Directory... So stay tuned for some blog posts about that. In the mean time stay safe and happy hacking!
